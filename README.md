LBVH
====

This project is an implementation of an LBVH build algorithm,
as described by Karras [here](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/karras2012hpg_paper.pdf).

One quality of LBVH trees is that they can be built very quickly.
This makes them an ideal choice for real time ray tracing.

As a single header library, you can easily integrate this into a ray tracing project and speed up your BVH build times!
